# House Price Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the median house price in Boston using linear regression.

# Data
The project utilizes the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information about 506 houses in the Boston metropolitan area. Each house has 13 features, including:

- Crime rate by town
- Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- Nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- Average number of rooms per dwelling
- Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- Weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres
- Index of accessibility to radial highways
- Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- Lower status of the population (percent)
- The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
# Libraries Used
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis  \

NumPy: Numerical computations\
Matplotlib: Data visualization\
Seaborn: Advanced data visualization\
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
# Data Preprocessing
Import libraries: Import the necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning.\
Load data: Load the Boston Housing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.\
Data exploration: Explore the data to understand its structure, missing values, and distribution of features.\
Data cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers if necessary.\
Feature engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to improve model performance.\
# Normalization: Normalize the features to ensure they are on the same scale.
# Model Training
Split data: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.\
Train model: Train a linear regression model on the training data.\
Evaluate model: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.\
# Results
Analyze results: Analyze the model's performance and interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model.\
Visualize results: Visualize the predictions made by the model and compare them to the actual values.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict house prices. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. The results can be used to understand the factors that influence house prices and to make predictions about future house prices.

# Github Repository
The code for this project will be uploaded to a Github repository. The repository will include:

Jupyter notebook with the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation\
README file with a detailed description of the project, including the data, methodology, and results\
Data file (Boston Housing dataset)\
# Additional Notes
This is a basic example of house price prediction using linear regression. More advanced techniques, such as random forests or gradient boosting, can be used to improve the model's accuracy.\
The project can be extended to include additional features, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, or to predict house prices in other cities.\
The project can be used as a starting point for further research on house price prediction or other real estate related problems.\
